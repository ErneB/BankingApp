This is a school project, which aims to create a secure form using and implementing PHP. 
This project was made following the teaching of Prof Prettyman.

Please note that the idea was to create an app using the three tiered system. Using an interface, business, and data tier.
This was one of my first big PHP projects, and is still actively being worked on.
